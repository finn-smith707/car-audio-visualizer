# Car Audio Visualizer
An audio visualizer made out of a VFD display from amazon designed to be mounted inside of a car.

This module is designed to mount to the inside of a 2007-2011 (Gen 6) Toyota Camry by removing the 2 center trim pieces sitting on either side of the center storage compartment. The screws on the inside are to be used in the mounting, as the holes on the bracket line up with the screw holes used on the inside of the trim. This might be able to work with other cars using the same parts, but I'm not too entirely sure on the specifics of that. This model uses a vacuum fluorecent display (VFD) to display the audio spectrum of whatever gets played into it. Looks cool, adds a little ambiance, and is a good conversation starter for whoever's riding with you.

## Materials needed
  - ~100g ABS or better filament
  - x1 Toyota Camry of compatable model year
  - x1 VFD Audio Visualizer (The one I used is this one: [https://a.co/d/aDb58MP](url))
  - x1 Cigarette lighter to 5V USB power adapter
  - x1 USB whatever the above uses to USB-C cord
  - x1 1-2 audio cord splitter? Idk what its called, but it's included with the VFD
  - x2 male-male audio jack
  - x1 Way to connect a phone to a female aux cord (bluetooth adapter, USB/lightning adapter, etc.)

## Printing & Assembly
The assembly is in two parts, one to bridge the gap between the center storage compartment, and one to mount that piece to the VFD. Print out both of those in a flat orientation, and I reccomend splitting the parts in the slicer to prevent warping if you're using ABS. Once that's done, you can superglue all of the parts together using the holes and nubs to line everything up and wait for the glue to cure. 

Next up, you should open up the center compartment and plug in the power supply, USB cord, and one of the aux lines. The next step would be to take the trim pieces off in order to reveal the screws. The trim pieces that I was previously talking about are shown below, circled in red.

In order to reveal the screws, just like pull those straight out. Pull with enough force to get the part out, but not with so much that you end up breaking it. Then, unscrew the two screws that you just uncovered, plug in the power cord and aux lines to the back of the VFD, and screw it back in. The mount should be sandwiched in between the screw and the storage compartment. After that, it's done, and you now have a neat little audio visualzier. 

## Important notes
  - Do NOT print with PLA or PETG. Any of those materials will end up melting in the hot sun and cause all sorts of unfortunate events to happen with the device.
  - Don't get water on it. I haven't tested how waterproof it is, but I wouldn't reccomend trying. I'm working on a shell/cover that should be out soon-ish

TLDR on the prototypes:
  - 1 - Mounted via duct tape. Works, but not well.
  - 2 - Mounted via tension. Never worked, never will.
  - 3 - Mounted via screws. Works perfectly, is the most up-to-date

You probably want the third one.
